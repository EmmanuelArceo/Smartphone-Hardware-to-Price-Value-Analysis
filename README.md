## Project Overview

This project analyzes smartphone value-for-money by comparing hardware specifications against launch prices across 930 smartphone models released between 2014 and 2025.

The goal was to determine:

- Which smartphone brands deliver the best value for money
- Which market tiers (Budget, Mid-range, Flagship) provide the highest pricing efficiency
- How smartphone value has evolved over time
- Whether rising smartphone prices are justified by hardware improvements

To accomplish this, I developed a custom Specs Score and Price-to-Specs Ratio to measure how much hardware consumers receive for every dollar spent.

## Dataset Overview

| Metric | Value |
|----------|----------|
| Total Smartphones Analyzed | 930 |
| Brands | 19 |
| Years Covered | 2014–2025 |
| Market Segments | Budget, Mid-range, Flagship |
| Variables | RAM, Storage, Cameras, Battery, Display Size, Processor Tier, Launch Price |

## Business Problem

Smartphone prices have steadily increased over the years, but consumers often struggle to determine whether those higher prices translate into meaningful hardware improvements.

This project investigates which brands and device categories provide the strongest value-for-money by comparing smartphone specifications against launch prices using a custom scoring model.

---

## Data Preparation

The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query.

### Data Cleaning Tasks

- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized smartphone brand names
- Converted specification values into numerical formats
- Validated launch price data
- Organized devices into Budget, Mid-range, and Flagship tiers
- Created calculated fields for analysis

---

## Feature Engineering

### Specs Score

A custom hardware scoring system was developed using:

- RAM Capacity
- Internal Storage
- Processor Tier
- Camera Configuration
- Battery Capacity
- Display Size

Higher scores indicate stronger overall hardware specifications.

### Price-to-Specs Ratio

Price ÷ Specs Score

Lower values indicate better value-for-money.

- Price-to-Specs Ratio decreased from 42.86 in 2014 to 9.72 in 2025.
- Hardware value improved by approximately 77%.

### 2. Best Value Smartphone Brands

1. iQOO
2. Realme
3. Infinix
4. POCO
5. Xiaomi

### 3. Flagship Smartphones Deliver Lower Value

| Tier | Ratio |
|--------|--------|
| Budget | 10.22 |
| Mid-range | 10.76 |
| Flagship | 18.46 |

Flagship devices cost approximately 81% more per hardware point than budget devices.

### 4. Hardware Improvements Outpaced Price Inflation

## Business Recommendations

### For Consumers

Consider Mid-range and Upper Mid-range devices for the strongest balance between price and performance.

### For Manufacturers

Focus on pricing efficiency as hardware improvements alone may not justify significant price premiums.

### For Retailers

Promote value-oriented brands such as iQOO, Realme, POCO, and Infinix to cost-conscious consumers.
